# User List Comparison

This is a JavaScript application that compares two lists of users and finds the unique users and common users between them.

## Problem Statement

Given two arrays `list1` and `list2` containing user names, the application finds the following outputs:

1. Unique users in `list1` that are not present in `list2`.
2. Unique users in `list2` that are not present in `list1`.
3. Users present in both `list1` and `list2` (common users).

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the JavaScript code in a JavaScript environment such as a browser console or a Node.js environment.
3. Open the browser console (if using a browser) to view the results.
4. If running in a browser console, open the browser developer tools (`Ctrl + Shift + J` in Google Chrome or `Cmd + Option + J` in Safari) to see the output.

## Usage

The application uses the provided JavaScript code to compare the lists and find unique and common users. Open the browser console to view the results.

## Sample Output

Unique Users in List1 not in List2: ["RolceRoyce", "Maruthi", "Tesla"]
Unique Users in List2 not in List1: ["Honda", "Bugati", "Ford"]
Common Users in both lists: ["Kia", "Ferrari", "Toyota"]
